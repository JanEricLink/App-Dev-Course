			<h2>Setup</h2>

			<h3>Board</h3>
			<p>The game board is made up of hexagonal tiles that represent different types of terrain (forest, hills, mountains, fields, pasture, and desert). The tiles are arranged randomly to create a unique board for each game.</p>

			<h3>Players</h3>
			<p>Each player chooses a color and takes the corresponding pieces. They place two settlements and two roads on the board. The first settlement is placed in player turn order; the second settlement is placed in reverse turn order (snake draft). After placement, players collect resource cards for any terrain hexes adjacent to their second settlement.</p>

  <h2>Game Rules</h2>
  <p>The following rules describe the full turn structure and key gameplay systems in <strong>Catan</strong> (Base Game, 3–4 players):</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Start of Turn – Dice Roll</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>The active player rolls two six-sided dice (2D6).</li>
        <li>Each terrain hex with a matching number produces resources for all players who have a settlement or city adjacent to that hex.</li>
        <li>Settlements yield <strong>1 resource card</strong>; cities yield <strong>2 resource cards</strong>.</li>
        <li>If a <strong>7</strong> is rolled:
          <ul>
            <li>No resources are produced.</li>
            <li>Every player holding more than 7 resource cards must discard half (rounded down).</li>
            <li>The active player moves the <strong>Robber</strong> to a new hex and steals 1 random resource card from a player with an adjacent settlement or city.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Trading Phase (Optional)</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>The active player may trade resources with other players or with the bank.</li>
        <li><em>Domestic Trade:</em> Players negotiate freely; trades must be agreed upon by both sides.</li>
        <li><em>Maritime Trade:</em> The player may trade with the bank using:
          <ul>
            <li>4:1 ratio — any four identical resources for one of any type.</li>
            <li>3:1 ratio — if the player has a generic harbor.</li>
            <li>2:1 ratio — if the player has a specialized harbor for that resource.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
